### ðŸ§  Go Programming at CBT Nuggets

Welcome to the [Go](https://go.dev) programming course at [CBT Nuggets](https://cbtnuggets.com)!
This git repository serves as a companion to the Golang video 
training that's available at CBT Nuggets.

In addition to Go programming, we offer training on many other topics:

* [MySQL](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/programming-and-development/my-sql-essentials)
* Kubernetes [CKA](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/blog/cbt-nuggets/new-course-certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka)
* Kubernetes [CKAD](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/linux/kubernetes-application-developer)
* Kubernetes [CKS](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/devops/kubernetes-security-specialist)
* [PowerShell](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/microsoft-windows-server/advanced-powershell-automation)
* [GitHub](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/programming-and-development/github)
* GitLab
* [AWS Cloud Automation with Python](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/aws/cloud-automation-python)
* ... and lots more!

I strongly encourage you to type out the code for yourself, to 
train your muscles on writing Go code.
However, if your initial objective is just to get some Go code 
running, and follow along with the video tutorials, then 
you can run the code samples in this git repository!
